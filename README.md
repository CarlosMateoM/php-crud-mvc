# PHP CRUD MVC
This PHP project consists of a web application that uses a custom router to manage routes. It includes a generic model for the creation of specific models, a database connection class and regular expressions to define dynamic routing patterns. The handling of notifications through sessions has been optimized, providing a secure and clean solution. The code follows good programming practices, such as modularization and use of classes and objects to improve maintainability.
